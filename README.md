# Process-Improvement-Case-Study
This case study demonstrates a process improvement project for a fast-paced food retail operation (ITSU-style) using Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). The project identifies inefficiencies in order fulfillment, redesigns the process using self-service kiosks and digital kitchen displays, and quantifies impact.
