# Process-Improvement-Case-Study
This case study demonstrates a process improvement project for a fast-paced food retail operation (ITSU-style) using Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). The project identifies inefficiencies in order fulfillment, redesigns the process using self-service kiosks and digital kitchen displays, and quantifies impact.

This ITSU-style process improvement project demonstrates how automation, digital communication, and parallel workflows can drive significant operational gains. By replacing manual order relay with KDS and dual queues with a unified kiosk, the store achieves:
36% fewer process steps
35% faster order cycle time
28% higher peak throughput
~68K–96K annual labor savings (at scale)
With disciplined implementation, clear stakeholder communication, and continuous metric tracking, this model is replicable across all the shops and defensible as a data-driven, customer-centric improvement initiative.
